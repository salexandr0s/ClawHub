<h1 align="center">ClawControl</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>Local-first ops console for AI agent orchestration.</strong></p>

Built on [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Track work orders, govern dangerous actions, stream agent activity in real-time.

---

## Quick Start

### Option A: Web Only (Simplest)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/salexandr0s/clawcontrol.git
cd clawcontrol
./setup.sh
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

### Option B: Desktop App (Electron) + Backend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/salexandr0s/clawcontrol.git
cd clawcontrol
npm install
cp apps/clawcontrol/.env.example apps/clawcontrol/.env
npm run db:migrate
npm run build --workspace=clawcontrol
./start.sh --desktop  # Starts backend + desktop app
```

### Option C: Download Release
1. Download the macOS desktop app artifact from [Releases](https://github.com/salexandr0s/clawcontrol/releases)
2. Install it (DMG/ZIP instructions vary by artifact)
3. Launch ClawControl (first time: right-click → Open to bypass Gatekeeper)

> **Note**: The desktop app auto-starts a local backend bound to `127.0.0.1:3000`.
> For remote control, use tunnel-only access. See [docs/REMOTE_TAILSCALE.md](docs/REMOTE_TAILSCALE.md).

## Why clawcontrol

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| AI agents run commands without oversight | **Governor** — typed confirmation for dangerous actions |
| No visibility into what agents are doing | **Live View** — real-time activity stream + receipt tailing |
| Features ship without tracking | **Work Orders** — spec → build → QA → ship pipeline |
| Agent state scattered across files | **Workspace** — browse/edit souls, overlays, skills, playbooks |
| Plugins change behavior silently | **Capability Probing** — UI shows what OpenClaw actually supports |

---

## Features

- **Work Orders** — Workflow-only execution with deterministic stage progression
- **Governor** — Policy-enforced approval gates (ALLOW / CONFIRM / WO_CODE / DENY)
- **Live View** — Streaming timeline, visualizer, receipt tail
- **Agents** — Soul files, overlays, capabilities, WIP limits
- **Templates** — Parameterized agent creation with validation
- **Skills** — Filesystem-backed, global or agent-scoped
- **Plugins** — OpenClaw-authoritative with capability probing
- **Maintenance** — Health checks, doctor, recovery workflows
- **Audit Trail** — Every action logged with receipts

---

## Execution Model

ClawControl runs a single execution mode for work delivery:

- `work-order -> workflow -> stage -> operation -> completion -> next stage`
- Work order start is only via `POST /api/work-orders/:id/start`
- Workflow definitions are loaded from YAML and selected deterministically
- Manual operation graph/status mutation is blocked by API guards

Canonical station names for workflows/agents: [docs/STATIONS.md](docs/STATIONS.md)

---

## OpenClaw Connection

ClawControl is designed to show **only real data**.

- If OpenClaw is available on PATH, ClawControl can query gateway status, cron jobs, plugins, sessions, and other OpenClaw-backed features.
- If OpenClaw is not available, ClawControl renders empty states and OpenClaw-backed features report **Unavailable** until OpenClaw is installed and configured.

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Node.js | 20+ |
| npm | 10+ |
| OpenClaw | 0.1.0+ (recommended for full functionality) |

```bash
node -v          # v20.x+
openclaw --version  # 0.1.0+ (recommended)
```

---

## Key Pages

| URL | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `/` | Redirects to `/dashboard` |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard overview |
| `/now` | Live activity stream |
| `/live` | Timeline + visualizer + receipts |
| `/work-orders` | Work order table + Kanban |
| `/agents` | Agent configuration |
| `/agent-templates` | Template management |
| `/skills` | Skill browser |
| `/plugins` | Plugin management |
| `/approvals` | Pending approval gates |
| `/workspace` | File browser |
| `/maintenance` | Health + recovery |

---

## Security

clawcontrol is designed for **local-first, single-user** operation.

### Governor System

Dangerous actions require typed confirmation:

```
Action: plugin.install
Policy: CONFIRM
→ Type "CONFIRM" to proceed
```

Risk levels: **ALLOW** (auto) → **CONFIRM** → **WO_CODE** → **DENY** (blocked)

### Path Safety

- No path traversal (`..` rejected)
- No backslashes or null bytes in workspace paths
- Symlink escape checks via resolved real paths
- Optional strict root allowlist mode via `CLAWCONTROL_WORKSPACE_ALLOWLIST_ONLY=1`

### Command Allowlist

OpenClaw execution limited to pre-defined commands. No arbitrary shell. Uses `spawn()` with array args.

### Audit Trail

All actions logged with timestamp, actor, entity, payload, receipt ID.

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for full threat model.

### Local-only Networking

- ClawControl stays bound to loopback only (`127.0.0.1` / `::1`)
- Never expose ClawControl via `0.0.0.0`, reverse proxies, or `tailscale serve`
- Remote access is supported only via user-initiated SSH tunnel (including over Tailscale)
