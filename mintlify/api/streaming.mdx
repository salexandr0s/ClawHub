# API: Streaming (SSE)

Purpose: real-time server-sent event feeds for activities, receipts, and gateway live graph.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/stream/activities`
- `GET /api/stream/receipts/:id`
- `GET /api/stream/openclaw`

## Connection Limits

Streaming endpoints use shared limiter logic with max `50` concurrent clients per endpoint bucket.

## Activities Stream

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/stream/activities"
```

Supports filters such as `type`, `entityType`, `entityId`, and `sinceId`.

## Receipt Stream

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/stream/receipts/<receiptId>"
```

Events include current state, `stdout`, `stderr`, and `finalized`.

## OpenClaw Graph Stream

```bash
curl -N "http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/stream/openclaw"
```

Events include `connected`, `snapshot`, and `delta` with optional query filtering by `agentId`, `sessionKey`, and `channel`.

## Error patterns

- `429` when connection limit is exceeded
- stream closes when source data is missing/finalized/aborted depending on endpoint
