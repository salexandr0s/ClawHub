# Security: Explicit Forbidden Exposure Paths

This page is an explicit deny-list for unsupported exposure patterns.

## Hard Not Allowed

- `tailscale serve` for ClawControl ports
- binding ClawControl to `0.0.0.0`
- exposing ClawControl through reverse proxy to LAN/WAN
- public tunnel exposure (`ngrok`, `cloudflared`, similar)
- disabling local-only safeguards for public access behavior

## Why

ClawControl is designed as a local-first admin console with single-user trust assumptions and local host enforcement. Unsupported exposure patterns break those assumptions.

## Supported Remote Pattern

Only user-initiated SSH local forwarding (including Tailscale transport) is supported.
