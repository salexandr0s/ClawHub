# Operations: Troubleshooting

This page is the troubleshooting index for ClawControl operators.

## Common Incident Areas

- startup failures
- port conflicts
- OpenClaw missing/unavailable
- gateway auth-required responses
- workspace validation failures
- loopback policy violations

## First-response Checks

1. Confirm local listeners are loopback only.
2. Confirm database path and migration state.
3. Confirm OpenClaw CLI exists on PATH.
4. Re-run gateway test from setup/settings flow.
5. Check activity/receipt logs for failed operations.
