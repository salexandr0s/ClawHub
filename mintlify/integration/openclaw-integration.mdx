# OpenClaw Integration

This page documents how ClawControl integrates with OpenClaw in the current implementation.

## Supported Binary and Version Expectation

- Supported binary: `openclaw`
- Minimum version expectation in code/docs: `0.1.0`
- CLI resolution supports explicit `OPENCLAW_BIN` override and common install paths

## Discovery and Resolution Behavior

Config resolution combines (in priority order):

1. ClawControl settings (`settings.json`)
2. environment variables
3. OpenClaw config discovery (`~/.openclaw`, `~/.OpenClaw`, `~/.moltbot`, `~/.clawdbot`)
4. default loopback gateway URLs

## Capability Probing

Capabilities endpoint probes OpenClaw and returns feature support map. Results are cached briefly and can be refreshed.

## Command Safety Model

- OpenClaw execution is allowlist-based.
- Commands run via `spawn` with array args (no shell interpolation).
- Dynamic command forms enforce required params.
- Command execution results are logged in receipts.

## Unavailable / Degraded Behavior

When OpenClaw is unavailable:

- API responses return unavailable/degraded states or errors per endpoint contract.
- UI renders empty or unavailable states using real data contracts.
- No fake/demo fallback data is generated.
